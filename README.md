# Spring Boot API Project

## Overview
This project is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for developing web applications. The API allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Student entity, showcasing the use of Spring Data JPA for database connectivity.

## Features
- **Project setup** using Spring Initializr and IntelliJ IDEA
- **Creating a simple API** with Spring Boot
- **Implementing the API layers**: Controller, Service, and Repository
- **Dependency Injection** using Spring's IoC container
- **Configuring application properties**
- **Creating and connecting to a database**
- **Using JPA and the `@Entity` annotation**
- **Implementing CRUD operations** using Spring Data JPA repositories
- **Handling HTTP methods** like POST, GET, and DELETE
- **Writing business logic** in the Service layer
- **Testing the API** using HTTP requests
- **Packaging and running the application**

## Project Structure
The project follows a typical layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate methods.
2. **Service Layer**: Encapsulates the business logic and interacts with the Repository layer.
3. **Repository Layer**: Provides an abstraction for data access using Spring Data JPA repositories.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/remiges-tejas/Springboot-amigocode-api.git
